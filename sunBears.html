<h1><center>Sun Bears: The Vulnerable</center></h1>
<br>
The Sun Bear is one of many endangered animals, such as the armadillo, the sea turtle, or the bengal tiger. These struggling creatures are the smallest of the bear species. They live in the humid tropical forests of Southeast Asia. These bears also eat both meat and plants (this means they are omnivores). Some things they eat are lizards, leaves, small rodents, berries, and honey of course!

Fun Facts...
<br>
<br>
Like all animals, the Sun Bear is classified into different groups that basically define the animal. For example, the Sun Bear's 'Domain' is Eukarya, which means that the cells of the organism (in our case a sun bear), have a true nucleus in each cell. Taxonomy is written in the order of Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and finally, Species. Here is the Sun Bear's taxonomy:
<br>
<br>
- Domain: Eukarya
<br>
<br>
- Kingdom: Animalia
<br>
<br>
- Class: Mammalia
<br>
<br>
- Order: Carnivora
<br>
<br>
- Family: Ursidae
<br>
<br>
- Genus: Helarctos
<br>
<br>
- Species: Helarctos malayanus
<br>
<br>
Another fun fact about Sun Bears is that their toungues can be from 7.9-9.8 inches long! They are also very good at climbing trees!
