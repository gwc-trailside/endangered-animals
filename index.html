<h3 style="color: #ff0000;"> What are Clouded leopards? </h3>
<p style="color: #ff6b9c;">  Clouded leopards are a species of wild cat that live in rainforests.  They can grow to be up to 3 feet tall and can weigh up to 50 pounds. Clouded leopards have silver/grey fur, black, cloud-shaped markings and a very big tail.  Also, their canine teeth are the largest, in porportion to body size, of any wild cat. </p>

<br>

<h3 style="color: #ff8800;"> Where do they live? </h3>
<p style="color: #ffb06b;">  Clouded leopards are often found living in the Himalayan Foothills in Nepal, as well as through the mainland of Southeast Asia and into China.  They climb trees a lot, so their prefered habitat is a rainforest. </p>

<br>

<h3 style="color: #fff000;"> What do they eat? </h3>
<p style="color: #fff76b;">  Clouded leopards are carnivores, and they eat animals such as deer, pigs, monkeys, squirrels, and birds. </p>

<br>

<h3 style="color: #00ff15;"> Why are they endangered? </h3>
<p style="color: #86ff6b;">  Clouded leopard's habitats have been dissappearing rapidly, due to deforestation.  There are also people who hunt Clouded leopards illegally.  Their bones are used to trade for medicine, and their meat is being used for exotic dishes. </p>
